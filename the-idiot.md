# The Idiot by Fyodor Dostoevsky

## Overview
Published in 1869, "The Idiot" is Dostoevsky's attempt to portray a "positively good man" - Prince Lev Nikolayevich Myshkin. The novel explores what happens when a truly innocent, Christ-like figure enters the corrupt world of Russian society.

## Main Characters

## Major Themes

### The Problem of Goodness
Can a truly good person survive in society? Myshkin's innocence and honesty consistently cause chaos and ultimately tragedy.

### Beauty and Destruction
"Beauty will save the world" - yet in the novel, beauty (Nastasya) leads to destruction. The tension between redemptive and destructive beauty.

### Suffering and Compassion
Myshkin's ability to understand others' suffering makes him beloved but also vulnerable. His compassion for Nastasya ultimately destroys him.

### Capital Punishment
Myshkin's powerful speech about a man's final moments before execution reflects Dostoevsky's own near-execution experience.
